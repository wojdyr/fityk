xylib
=====

xylib is a portable C++ library for reading files that contain x-y data from
powder diffraction, spectroscopy or other experimental methods.

Supported formats:

-  plain text (CSV or TSV or space-separated-values)
-  Crystallographic Information File for Powder Diffraction (pdCIF)
-  Siemens/Bruker UXD
-  Siemens/Bruker RAW ver. 1/2/3/4
-  Philips UDF
-  Philips RD (raw scan) V3
-  Rigaku DAT
-  Sietronics Sieray CPI
-  DBWS/DMPLOT data file
-  Canberra MCA *(only one of Canberra MCA formats?)*
-  XFIT/Koalariet XDD
-  RIET7/LHPM/CSRIET/ILL\_D1A5/PSI\_DMC DAT
-  Vamas ISO14976
   *(only experiment modes: SEM or MAPSV or MAPSVDP are supported; 
   only REGULAR scan_mode is supported)*
-  Princeton Instruments WinSpec SPE
   *(only 1-D data is supported)*

For API description, see `xylib/xylib.h`__ file.

INSTALLATION
============

You can download `source tarball`_ or use Subversion repository_. 

To build xylib you need:

* any modern C++ compiler 
* Boost_ libraries (only at compile time). 

.. _`source tarball`: http://downloads.sourceforge.net/fityk/xylib-0.5.tar.bz2
.. _repository: https://fityk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fityk/trunk/xylib
.. _Boost: http://www.boost.org/

**Linux, FreeBSD, etc:** 
the library can be compiled in a standard ``./configure && make`` way. 
If you downloaded the source from svn, you need to run ``autoreconf -i`` before.

MISC NOTES
==========

The file `sample-urls`__ contains links to files in formats handled by xylib.

__ https://fityk.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/fityk/trunk/xylib/sample-urls

The library comes with a tiny program *xyconv*, which converts files
supported by xylib to TSV.

xylib is used by:

-  `fityk <http://www.unipress.waw.pl/fityk>`_
-  `xyConvert <http://www.unipress.waw.pl/fityk/xyconvert>`_

HOW TO ADD A NEW FORMAT
=======================

We will be glad to include support for (almost) any format. 
You may contact us before you start working.

Each ``.cpp``/``.h`` file pair in ``xylib/`` (excluding ``xylib.*``
and ``util.*``) corresponds to one supported filetype.

Each of these ``.cpp`` files contains basic info about the format
in constructor of ``struct FormatInfo``. Each header files includes
a note what the implementation is based on (i.e. what documentation
was available to developers). In some cases the format is described
in ``.cpp`` file.

To add a new filetype:

-  go to ``xylib/`` subdirectory
-  write ``new_format.cpp`` and ``.h`` files
-  ``#include new_format.h`` in ``xylib.cpp``
-  add an entry to ``formats[]`` array in ``xylib.cpp``
-  add ``new_format.cpp`` and ``.h`` files to ``Makefile.am``

-  Google - the library was started as Google Summer of Code 2007 project 
   by Peng ZHANG, mentored by Marcin Wojdyr from Fityk organization.
-  Michael Richardson provided VAMAS specification and sample files.
-  David Hovis provided a WinSpec file format specification and sample files.
-  Pablo Bianucci provided his code for reading WinSpec format and sample files.
-  Brian H. Toby suggested adding pdCIF format.
-  Martijn Fransen provided very useful specifications of Philips formats.
-  Vincent Favre-Nicolin provided PSI\_DMC and ILL\_D1A5 samples;
   reading his ObjCryst library was also helpful.
-  Janos Vegh sent us his VAMAS reading routines (long time ago, before this 
   project started). 
-  Andreas Breslau added Bruker V3 (RAW1.01) support.
-  Bjørn Tore Lønstad provided Bruker RAW V3 format specification and samples.
