* check in configure if tr1 is present, to avoid run-time dependency of boost
  (cache.h includes boost)

* handle CR as a newline (and perhaps also others from 
  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newline)
* add rigaku_dat sample files
* is Rigaku RIG the same as rigaku_dat?   
* implement GSAS format (see gsas.cpp for comments) 
* PANalytical XRDML
* consider adding JCAMP format (Standard NMR Data Format)
* "read text as nan" option for text files, for reading CSV files with both 
  text and numeric colums
* support URIs (using libcurl, libfetch or boost:asio)
