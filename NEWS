User-visible changes in version 0.7.3  (2006-04-11):
* extended data transformations: numarea(%f, x1, x2, n) gives area integrated
  numerically (from x1 to x2, n steps), Y = y-%f(x) substracts function from
  data, findx(%f, x1, x2, y) finds x in (x1, x2) such that %f(x)=y,
  extremum(%f, x1, x2) finds x in (x1, x2) such that %f'(x)=0,
  transformations can be joined with ',' (previously '&' was used),
  randuniform(a, b), randnormal(mu, sigma) generate random numbers,
  y[x=21] gives y at x=21 using linear interpolation between two points
* user defined functions derived from other functions, eg:
   define Ga(area,center,hwhm) = Gaussian(area/fwhm/sqrt(pi*ln(2)),center,hwhm)
* optional logarithmic scaling of y axis
