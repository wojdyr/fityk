User-visible changes in version 1.3.0  (2015-05-25):
* support filenames with non-ascii characters
* simple-variable ~NUM can be followed by domain, e.g.: %f=Linear(~3[2:5], ~8)
  and also default parameters can have domain (...shape=~0.5 [0:1],...),
  Voigt and PseudoVoigt have now shape with default domain [0:1]
* if variable has a domain (example: $a = ~1.2 [-3:4]) then

  constraints in fitting methods that support it (default: on)

User-visible changes in version 1.1.1  (2011-09-28):

  interpolation is used.
* added calculation of Polyline derivatives, what enables weighted least
  squares approximation by broken lines
