* (GUI) sidebar bottom panel -> draw draft of peak when changing peak parameters

* DataExpressionG: 
    %func(DataExpressionG) #OP_FUNC number #eg. Y = y-%peak(x)       
    F(DataExpressionG)     #OP_CURVE_Y number
    Z(DataExpressionG)     #OP_CURVE_DX number
    %peak[area]            #OP_NUMBER
        - to avoid ambiguity,  '%' should be replaced with 'mod' (?)
    '&' -> ',' (?)
    aggregate functions: min, max, sum, avg, stddev, eg.  min(y if 20<x<25)
      area function?  area(y-F(x) if 20<x<25)    -> (x[n+1]-x[n-1])/2 * t
    parametrized functions with parameters as expression: spline[x if ...](x)
      ->step equilibration: X = x[0] + (x[-1]-x[0])/(M-1) * n
     			  & Y = interpolate[x y](X)
     			  & S = interpolate[x s](X)
     			  & A = interpolate[x a](X)

* [BUG] sum() doesn't work in "info sum(x)" or $a={sum(y)}

* [internal] UI - two implementations of one class are bad idea  
	     it must be a base class (virtual?) with derived GUI and CLI

* (GUI) sidebar: default column widths should be different

* (GUI) use numeric pad keys (WXK_NUMPAD_*) as shortcuts for changing 
	function parameters.

* (GUI) more extensive and configurable (2/3 buttons, size) mouse hints 
	   (also for aux. plot, etc)

* function: EMG (expotentially modified gauss)

* GUI: print: if no sum, don't print aux plot

* GUI: it should be possible to constrain two parameters of two peak,
     at least to make them equal.

* GUI: easy way to do: F[hwhm]=..., F[shape]=...;

* GUI: button 'freeze' on variables pane

* cmd: any-command with option=value 
         -- set value of option for this command only

* GUI [BUG] aux. plot - when program is called with script as an argument
   aux. plot looks strange at the start of the program until it is replotted

* Fitting 
	settings: GUI, fitting
	greyed fit-continue menu/button
	cmd: fit with more options
	simulated annealing (it can replace LM shake_before option)
	autoplot option -> fitting tab, checkbox: replot-after-fit-iteration

* GUI: menu Functions:
  Functions > Peak-Find Info -> animation
  Functions > Multidata P-F Info -> window with list of parameters (Xview-like)

* parameter domain ~3[2,14]

* Function: check_parameters_out_of_domain() ?  
             eg. in Pearson shape > 0.5 , shape < 1e9
	     called from fitting iteration?
	     what if parameter is out-of-domain? change? disable function?
	                                          change and freeze?
	     set fit-fix-parameters-times = 5
	    simple-var bounds?

* GUI: Data Editor - left/right/top/bottom - magic keywords: user would be
       asked to select point/range/rectangle in plot

* history  (data / sum / view / all)

* cmd/GUI: plot peak-groups: ==> plot (%a+%b+%c)  

* (GUI) different peak-draft for steps (new function category), 
         and for other functions

* [internal] are functions recalculate()'d when neccessary? eg.before copy(%f)?

* [internal] mark parameters, which are not used in sum calculation, and don't
             put it into matrix (?)

* (GUI) where config files should be stored on MS Windows? Registry of file?

* (GUI) peak positions as an option to any aux. plot 
        (not separate type of aux.p.)

* (GUI) new aux. plot type: cumulative chi2 (normalized, ie. cum. chi2 / (N-P))

* (GUI) show function limits when cursor is over peak top

* data tranformations: new functions: randuniform[a b]() randnormal[mu sigma]()

* key [del] at data pane should work as close button

* improve Voigt function (cut-tails, better approx?) 

* (GUI) vertical scaling using mouse on main plot near to left edge of the plot 

* (GUI) peak dragging -- sensible scaling of parameter changes 
           (problems with width changing)

------------------ 

* view with/without background button (like in 0.4.x, requires storing
  background points)

* user defined functions 
      - syntax:
        --> define Gaussian(a,pos,width): a*exp(-((x-pos)/width)^2)
	                   ^^^ any name but 'x' allowed here
	--> %g = Gaussian(1,$b,~3.4)
      - more sophisticated simplifications of expressions and CSE(!)
      - calculating limits, width, area, etc. for UDF(!)

------------------ 

* (CODE STYLE) propagate errors using exceptions (when suitable) rather 
  than error codes

* (CODE STYLE) use smart pointers: 
  http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm
  (the library will be distributed in 3rdparty/boost)

* build engine (everything but GUI/CLI interface) as a library
  with documented API.

* problem: fityk can't be compiled with UNICODE-enabled wxWidgets

* (WWW) update screenshots 

* there are problems with refreshing plots and output window when program
  is busy (ie. when running script or fitting). It seems to be platform
  dependent.

* write a good portable .spec (spec is used for building RPM)

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* (GUI) file preview (in grid) in "Load File Custom" dialog 
  setting initial path to currently loaded file (calling SetPath() 
  is giving segfault, don't know why) 
  Perhaps use wxGenericFileDialog instead of wxGenericDirCtrl (?)

* logarithmic scale  

* loading data -- use Difdaf library (when it will be ready) for powder
  diffraction data import.
  other formats (from survey): .jdx JCAMP-DX (www.jcamp.org)
		         Galactic (GRAMS/32) SPC files (especially multifiles)

* (GUI) one dialog for plot settings. More precise configuration of axis tics.
  horizontal/vertical peak labels, etc.
  single ergonomic interface changing colors of everything(?)

* python scripts  -- built-in Python interpreter which allows to extend 
  Fityk using user-written scripts, optional modules, etc. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* rewrite crystallographic part in python
  [IMPORTANT]

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user don't want to wait longer);
  use threads?

* automatic background substraction - what are good algorithms?

* (F > file) when exporting function/sum as points, it shuld be possible 
  to set step of these points (s.set export-points-step = 0.?)
  and to export baseline and each peak as a separately (multicolumn CSV)

* (Windows only) exporting plots to PostScript file and to metafile(clipboard) 

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (COOOL,
  GAUL, WNLIB, netlib, OOL.sf.net
  are there any other such libraries? 
  I haven't investigated the possibility of using mentioned libs yet. 
  Links: http://coool.mines.edu/ http://gaul.sourceforge.net/, 
  http://www.willnaylor.com/wnlib.html,
  http://sal.jyu.fi/B/3/index.shtml, http://coin-or.org,
  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/faq/nonlinear-programming-faq.html) 

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface Fit > Info
  easy way to get (write to file) parameters with errors [IMPORTANT]

* Now only '.' is supported as a decimal separator. ',' should also
  be an option.

* (GUI) "Report Bug" item in Help menu, clickable link in About dialog
        http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/wiki.pl?Launching_The_Default_Browser

* investigate LLVM - can it be used for faster calculation of 
  user-defined functions?
