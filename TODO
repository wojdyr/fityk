If you know C++ and would like to help improving fityk, but you don't know were
to start, there is a list of ideas at the end of this file.

---------- TODO list and tentative development plan  ----------------
Legend:
// = done, but not tested/documented  

* %name = guess Linear in @*  -- should give error for more than one dataset

* GUI: save (and load) cmd line history to ~/.fityk/wxhistory

* gtk: opening definition manager causes Gtk-CRITICAL warning (wx2.9)

* GUI: check if "shadow unselected" works on MSW

* GUI: test printing on MSW

--------------> 0.8.3

* GUI: refactor MainPlot - mouse event handling based on subscriptions,
       a clean interface to XOR-drawing 

* embedding python scripts or other plugin-like solution  [IMPORTANT]
  perhaps IPC instead of embedded scripting language?

* rewrite old crystallographic part in python [IMPORTANT]

--------------> 0.9.0

* GUI: should (and where) windows size & position be stored?

* (GUI) plot horizontal/vertical lines (X/Y | pos=2.34 | 100% | title="50steps")
     can be used to show theoretical peak positions in XRD
     (or to make stress-strain curves in MD with marked simulation restarts)

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user doesn't want to wait longer);
  "stop" bitmap button? in right left corner? 

* GUI: default view is too wide from the left in when logarithmic scale is on,
  because view margin is always 5%, and this is handled by libfityk

* BUG: "plot . []" sometimes doesn't work as expected if x axis is not visible.

* ? rewrite manual in Markdown or Crossmark 

--------------> 

* making libfityk thread-safe (pass around Fityk* F, remove all `AL',
   remove static class members and global variables)

* BUG, parsing problem: "i $a*$a" => Syntax error; "i 0+$a*$a" => OK

* export multiple datasets to one data file
* (?)exporting data with info "info @n () [range] > file"
  if not redirected, should display ... [1234 lines more] rather than all lines

* GUI: buttons on sidebar>functions that make hwhm and shape equal
  for all functions (F[hwhm]=...; F[shape]=...) or independent.
  buttons should be active only when it's possible
   should also affect graphical peak adding (all 3 ways)

* sorting lists at sidebar - by clicking on column header, 
  use case: sort functions by centers
  involves refactoring ListWithColors::populate()

* GUI: in script editor, "info ...> file" should be marked differently
  than not redirected info 
  paths of files to be read should be checked 

* unused variables should not slow down fitting

* add alpha channel to toolbar icons

* fitting with constrained parameters

------------------ 

* GUI: script editor: button to change directories in absolute filenames

* GUI: button '(un)lock' on variables pane [waiting for wx-toggle-bitmap-button]

* GUI: [when wx3 is released, with customizable file dlg] change file dialogs
  
* [Infrastructure] Set up BuildBot or similar system for build tests

* user defined functions:
      - more sophisticated simplifications of expressions and CSE(!)
      - calculating limits, width, area, etc. for UDF(!)

* un-strip background: what to do if active dataset is different than the one
  the background was removed for.

* EMG function: how to calculate it? Now there are some problems with
  this function. There must be smarter way to implement it...
  perhaps using gsl_sf_log_erfc

* ? GUI: changing data point size and line separately for each dataset,

* info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface Fit > Info

* improve Voigt function (cut-tails, better approx.) 
  eg. http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=77626.77629

* GUI: it should be possible to constrain two parameters of two peak,
     at least to make them equal.

* GUI: menu Functions:
  Functions > Peak-Find Info -> animation
  Functions > Multidata P-F Info -> window with list of parameters (Xview-like)

* Function: check_parameters_out_of_domain() ?  
             eg. in Pearson shape > 0.5 , shape < 1e9
	     called from fitting iteration?
	     what if parameter is out-of-domain? change? disable function?
	                                          change and freeze?
	     set fit-fix-parameters-times = 5
	    simple-var bounds?
	    ? $$simple = ~{min2(max2($simple, -1e9), 1e9)}

* GUI: Data Editor - left/right/top/bottom - magic keywords: user would be
       asked to select point/range/rectangle in plot

* cmd/GUI: plot peak-groups: ==> plot (%a+%b+%c)  

* (GUI) different peak-draft for sigmoids/steps (new function category), 
         and for other functions

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* (GUI) single dialog for configuring main plot (and also aux. plots) (?)

* (GUI) vertical scaling using mouse on main plot near to left edge of the plot 

* (GUI, BUG) in Configure axes / peak labels: fonts are changed even
  if Apply is not pressed

* automatic background substraction - what are good algorithms?

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* fitting: GA fitting options, 
  a way to "shake" parameters for L-M

* fitting:
	simulated annealing (it can replace LM shake_before option)
	perhaps also BFGS, conjugate gradients methods

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (COOOL,
  GAUL, WNLIB, netlib, OOL.sf.net, levmar, GSL and 3rd-party extensions to GSL)
  are there any other such libraries? 
  I haven't investigated the possibility of using mentioned libs yet.

  http://www.ics.forth.gr/~lourakis/levmar/

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* investigate LLVM - can it be used for faster calculation of 
  user-defined functions?

* [BUG] (GUI) (MS Win) <br> does not work in vertical peak labels 

* exporting formulae in MathML (when option formula-export-style == mathml)

* [BUG]: program crashes (MS Win 9x) when data contains NaN (as a result
  of asin(x) x>1) and "Zoom all" is called.


-------  Ideas for people, who would like to contribute:  -----------

- write a function to calculate a Voigt/Faddeeva function, based on one 
  (or more) of papers published about it. I mean here an approximation more 
  exact that the standard Humlicek one. GSL would probably also accept
  such a function in C.
  http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gsl-discuss/2004-q4/msg00061.html

- if you have some expertise in nonlinear optimization methods, it's possible
  to do what Gnu Scientific Library seems to plan: put a few least-squares
  fitting methods with similar interface into one library. 
  It can be part of fityk, a separate library or a part of GSL.

- GUI: InputLine is a widget, that doesn't depend on the rest of fityk code.
  http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=13005
  It would be nice to have tab-completion in InputLine, like we have in CLI,
  thanks to readline library. Ideally, the code for finding completion in CLI
  should be possible to use with InputLine.

- see the note about EMG function above

- anything else
