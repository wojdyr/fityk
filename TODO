[Suggestions from Fityk users survey are not included here yet.]

* document s.guess command 

* problem: fityk can't be compiled with UNICODE-enabled wxWidgets

* problem: problem with locales, that has decimal point different than '.' 
  as a workaround, run LC_NUMERIC=en_US

* problem: ambigous 'log' in "export as function" (in gnuplot it means
  natural, in Excel log=log10). 

* --debug / --release configure flag, equivalent to: -g -fno-inline 
  / -O3 -s -DNDEBUG 

* automate (as possible) procedure of releasing new version

* www page with links to various peak-fitting programs (based on results
  of survey)

* d.transform  --  new powerful command for transforming data, 
      that will replace d.deviation, d.range(?). It is partially done
      (as a separate program) using boost::spirit. Examples:
      d.transform Y[n>0] = Y[n-1] + y[n]     -> will integrate data
      d.transform S = sqrt(max(1,y[n]))      -> will set std. dev.
      d.transform x=y & y=x                  -> will swap x and y axes 

* data viewer (grid); GUI for d.transform command 

* write (and verify) program version in scripts; write version/date in config 
  files 

* problem: "exit" command in script. What should it do? 
  The same about warning/error, when 'exit-on-error=1' is set

* More visible toolbar icons (icons 5-9 from left must be changed).
  Perhaps bigger (24x24) icons should be used?

* new command line options: -d and --data that will load data file
  Perhaps 'fityk nacl01.dat' should also load data file?
  Automatically recognize if it is script or data?

* (s.add) possiblity to add description of peak/parameter 
  This description could be used eg. in exporting files.

* loading data -- use Difdaf library (when it will be ready) for powder
  diffraction data import.

* (loading data) -- merging a few file
  rewrite loading ASCII data 
  change order of arguments in syntax of d.load command 

* d.load: optimize loading file with xy data 

* redesign "Load File Custom" dialog 

* rewrite scanner/parser using boost::spirit. Now it uses flex/bison.
  [IMPORTANT]

* document source with Doxygen [IMPORTANT]  

* user defined functions; it includes symbolic computing of derivatives.
  Important but needs a lot of work. Perhaps the idea of simple parameters,
  compund-parameters and functions will be revised. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* python scripts  -- built-in Python interpreter which allows to extend 
  Fityk using user-written scripts, optional modules, etc. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* rewrite crystallographic part in python
  [IMPORTANT]

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user don't want to wait longer);
  use threads?

* automatic background substraction - what algorithm is good?

* (plotting) smoothing curves where data points are sparse (computations for 
  additional points)

* exporting file dialogs - (d.export and s.export) default filenames in GUI

* (s.export) when exporting function/sum as points, it shuld be possible 
  to set step of these points (s.set export-points-step = 0.?)

* (Windows only) exporting plots to PostScript file and to metafile(clipboard) 

* problem: MS Windows - tree at data pane looks bad

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* write documentation for fwhm-correction and height-correction (m.set) 

* single ergonomic interface changing colors of everything

* short-cuts for menu commands (Ctrl-O, F1, etc.)

* improve Voigt function (FWHM, cut-tails, better approx?) 

* (GUI) in input ComboBox up/down arrow keys should work like 
  in bash -- moving in command history. (use TextCtrl instead of ComboBox)

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (AFAIK there 
  is no such libary -- with unified interface to various nonlinear 
  optimisation methods). 
  Add more methods, eg. simulated annealing 

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* f.info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface to f.info
