If you know C++ and would like to help improving fityk code, but you don't 
know what to do, there is a list of ideas at the end of this file.

---------- TODO list and tentative development plan  ----------------

* make stand-alone converter utility that uses xylib and wx >= 2.9,
  built explicitely by "make xyConvert" in src/wxgui/

--------------> 2.8.5

* add crystallographic module/extension 

* GUI: refactor MainPlot - mouse event handling based on subscriptions,
       a clean interface to XOR-drawing 

--------------> 2.9

* GUI, toolbar: remove "continue fitting" and add "undo fitting"
* configure.ac: 
  --enable-samples-install  Install samples as documentation 
    (to .../share/doc/fityk/samples/, only *.fit and *.dat files)

* GUI: should (and where) windows size & position be stored?

* (GUI) plot horizontal/vertical lines (X/Y | pos=2.34 | 100% | title="50steps")
     can be used to show theoretical peak positions in XRD
     (or to make stress-strain curves in MD with marked simulation restarts)

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user doesn't want to wait longer);
  "stop" bitmap button? in right left corner? 

* GUI: default view is too wide from the left in when logarithmic scale is on,
  because view margin is always 5%, and this is handled by libfityk

* BUG: "plot . []" sometimes doesn't work as expected if x axis is not visible.

* convert manual from DocBook to reStructuredText

* data import: possibility to use xylib column/block name as title

--------------> 

* BUG, parsing problem: "i $a*$a" => Syntax error; "i 0+$a*$a" => OK

* GUI: buttons on sidebar>functions that make hwhm and shape equal
  for all functions (F[hwhm]=...; F[shape]=...) or independent.
  buttons should be active only when it's possible
   should also affect graphical peak adding (all 3 ways)

* sorting lists at sidebar - by clicking on column header, 
  use case: sort functions by centers
  involves refactoring ListWithColors::populate()

* GUI: in script editor, "info ...> file" should be marked differently
  than not redirected info 
  paths of files to be read should be checked 

* unused variables should not slow down fitting

* add alpha channel to toolbar icons

* fitting with constrained parameters

------------------ 

* GUI: script editor: button to change directories in absolute filenames

* GUI: button '(un)lock' on variables pane [waiting for wx-toggle-bitmap-button]

* [Infrastructure] Set up BuildBot or similar system for build tests

* user defined functions:
      - more sophisticated simplifications of expressions and CSE(!)
      - calculating limits, width, area, etc. for UDF(!)

* un-strip background: what to do if active dataset is different than the one
  the background was removed for.

* EMG function: how to calculate it? Now there are some problems with
  this function. There must be smarter way to implement it...
  perhaps using gsl_sf_log_erfc or exp(x*x)*erfc(x) from
  http://www.netlib.org/specfun/erf

* ? GUI: changing data point size and line separately for each dataset,

* info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface Fit > Info

* improve Voigt function (cut-tails, better approx.) 
  eg. http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=77626.77629

* GUI: it should be possible to constrain two parameters of two peak,
     at least to make them equal.

* GUI: menu Functions:
  Functions > Peak-Find Info -> animation
  Functions > Multidata P-F Info -> window with list of parameters (Xview-like)

* Function: check_parameters_out_of_domain() ?  
             eg. in Pearson shape > 0.5 , shape < 1e9
	     called from fitting iteration?
	     what if parameter is out-of-domain? change? disable function?
	                                          change and freeze?
	     set fit-fix-parameters-times = 5
	    simple-var bounds?
	    ? $$simple = ~{min2(max2($simple, -1e9), 1e9)}

* GUI: Data Editor - left/right/top/bottom - magic keywords: user would be
       asked to select point/range/rectangle in plot

* cmd/GUI: plot peak-groups: ==> plot (%a+%b+%c)  

* add a new function category: sigmoids/steps (now function can be guessed as
  "peak" and "linear"). (GUI): drawing drafts for the new category.

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* (GUI) vertical scaling using mouse on main plot near to left edge of the plot 

* (GUI) single dialog for configuring main plot (and also aux. plots) (?)
* (GUI, BUG) in Configure axes / peak labels: fonts are changed even
  if Apply is not pressed

* automatic background substraction - what are good algorithms?

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* fitting: GA fitting options, 
  a way to "shake" parameters for L-M

* fitting:
	simulated annealing (it can replace LM shake_before option)
	perhaps also BFGS, conjugate gradients methods

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (COOOL,
  GAUL, WNLIB, netlib, OOL.sf.net, levmar, GSL and 3rd-party extensions to GSL,
  scitbx::lbfgs)
  are there any other such libraries? 
  I haven't investigated the possibility of using mentioned libs yet.

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* investigate LLVM - can it be used for faster calculation of 
  user-defined functions?

* [BUG] (GUI) (MS Win) <br> does not work in vertical peak labels 

* exporting formulae in MathML (when option formula-export-style == mathml)

* [BUG]: program crashes (MS Win 9x) when data contains NaN (as a result
  of asin(x) x>1) and "Zoom all" is called.

-------  Anticipated upgrades  -----------

* when Boost::Spirit 2 is released, parsers will be rewritten and 
  libfityk will be made thread-safe (removing all `AL' and all static class 
  members and global variables)

* when wxWidgets 3.x will be available in major Linux distributions:
  - open-file dialog (with preview) will use XyBrowser
  - file dialogs will be changed to take adventage of custom controls:
      * Choose log file: add "log also output" checkbox
      * Data > Export will be done in one step
      * "Export formula" dialog will have formula-export-style option
  - wxAboutBox will be used instead of AboutDlg


-------  Ideas for people, who would like to contribute:  -----------

- write a function to calculate a Voigt/Faddeeva function, based on one 
  (or more) of papers published about it. I mean here an approximation more 
  exact that the standard Humlicek one. GSL would probably also accept
  such a function in C.
  http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gsl-discuss/2004-q4/msg00061.html

- see the note about EMG function above

- if you have some expertise in nonlinear optimization methods, it's possible
  to do what Gnu Scientific Library seems to plan: put a few least-squares
  fitting methods with similar interface into one library. 
  It can be part of fityk, a separate library or a part of GSL.

- Add alpha channel to toolbar icons. Fityk icons are usually modified GTK 
  stock icons. Alpha-channel was removed when converting to xpm format.
  Now I see icons with alpha-channel look much better (like menu icons,
  visible in GTK version only), but making the icons again takes time...

- anything else
