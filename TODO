* More visible toolbar icons (icons 5-9 from left must be changed).
  Bigger (24x24) icons should be used. Data editor tool.

* short-cuts for menu commands (Ctrl-O, F1, etc.)

------------------ 0.5.1  2005.06

* data tranformations: handle "3 < x < 4" like "3 < x and x < 4"
                       new functions: randuniform[a b]() randnormal[mu sigma]()
                       temporary variables
		       documentation

* data export -- in first (commented) lines: title and column 
  description (x, y, sigma). Data loading should check for this info.

* (GUI) datapane - hint with full filenames, editable labels (titles)
                  "duplicate" command, when right-clicking on inactive label
		  [new dataset: title1 + title2] menu item

* problem: MS Windows - tree at data pane looks bad

* (GUI) data viewer - "Apply" button should be inactive when statement
  grammar 


------------------ 0.5.2  2005.07

* user defined functions; it includes symbolic computing of derivatives and CSE.
  Important but needs a lot of work. Perhaps the idea of simple parameters,
  compund-parameters and functions will be revised. 
  [IMPORTANT]

------------------ 0.6.0 2005.??

* problem: fityk can't be compiled with UNICODE-enabled wxWidgets

* (WWW) update screenshots 

* there are problems with refreshing plots and output window when program
  is busy (ie. when running script or fitting). It seems to be platform
  dependent.

* write a good portable .spec (spec is used for building RPM)

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* (GUI) file preview (in grid) in "Load File Custom" dialog 
  setting initial path to currently loaded file (calling SetPath() 
  is giving segfault, don't know why) 
  Perhaps use wxGenericFileDialog instead of wxGenericDirCtrl (?)

* integrate m.findpeak and s.add options. Prepare interface for many
  peak detection algorithms

* document s.guess command 

* logarithmic scale  

* (s.add) possibility to add description of peak/parameter 
  This description could be used e.g. in exporting files.

* loading data -- use Difdaf library (when it will be ready) for powder
  diffraction data import.
  other formats (from survey): .jdx JCAMP-DX (www.jcamp.org)
		         Galactic (GRAMS/32) SPC files (especially multifiles)

* (GUI) one dialog for plot settings. More precise configuration of axis tics.
  horizontal/vertical peak labels, etc.
  single ergonomic interface changing colors of everything

* rewrite scanner/parser using boost::spirit. Now it uses flex/bison.
  [IMPORTANT]

* python scripts  -- built-in Python interpreter which allows to extend 
  Fityk using user-written scripts, optional modules, etc. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* rewrite crystallographic part in python
  [IMPORTANT]

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user don't want to wait longer);
  use threads?

* automatic background substraction - what are good algorithms?

* (s.export) when exporting function/sum as points, it shuld be possible 
  to set step of these points (s.set export-points-step = 0.?)
  and to export baseline and each peak as a separately (multicolumn CSV)

* possibility to subtract fitted functions from the data (ie peak removal)

* (Windows only) exporting plots to PostScript file and to metafile(clipboard) 

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* write documentation for fwhm-correction and height-correction (m.set) 

* improve Voigt function (FWHM, cut-tails, better approx?) 

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (COOOL,
  GAUL, are there any other such libraries? I haven't investigated
  the possibility to use COOOL and GAUL yet. Links: http://coool.mines.edu/
  http://gaul.sourceforge.net/) 

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* f.info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface to f.info; 
  easy way to get (write to file) parameters with errors [IMPORTANT]

* Now only '.' is supported as a decimal separator. ',' should also
  be an option.

* (GUI) "Report Bug" item in Help menu, clickable link in About dialog
