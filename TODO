[ TODO list and tentative development plan ]
[ // = done, but not tested/documented     ]

* !!! BUG: data load: sigma is _not_ set as sqrt(y)

// * (GUI) error bars for data

* BUG, GUI, MS Windows only: commands "@+ <" and "@0 <" executed from script
  give error: "Couldn't retrieve information about list control item 1."

* BUG: problem with default parameters of functions (reported by WANG)

* // BUG: minor logging issue (c+ >log2.fit) [done?]
  //        problem with logging on MSW (solved?)

* data transformation?: transform(sum_points_with_dx, 1e-9) in @0
             or         @0 < @0.sum_points_with_dx(1e-9)  

* GUI: definition manager: 
   - add support for sum of functions
   - upper-case parameter names should be make lower case, rather than vanish

* voigt(x,y) function for data transformations and variable definitions

* auto-scaling should not include x/y=0, unless it's
  in, say, 20% plot margin. "[:]" is an exception and includes 0.
  GUI: "Auto-zooms shows y=0"
* plot - there should be a way to zoom to show all datasets (plot @* [])
* GUI?: when loading many datasets from command line, set view to show all

* clean up verbosity levels of messages. There should be 6 kind of messages:
  debug, vinfo (more verbose info), info, warning, 
  rinfo (explicitely requested info), error
  and levels of verbosity: debug, verbose, normal, terse (warnings), 
    quiet (rinfo+errors)

------------------ perhaps release here 0.7.8

* build engine (everything but GUI/CLI interface) as a library
  with more or less documented API.
    tentative basic API: 
      int dataset_count();
      string info(string const& s);
      Command::Status execute(string const& s);
      typedef void message_handler_func(OutputStyle style, string const& s);
      void message_handler(message_handler_func);

------------------ next release here 0.8.0

* GUI: change focus from pane to input field when proper keys are pressed.
* python scripts  -- built-in Python interpreter which allows to extend 
  Fityk using user-written scripts, optional modules, etc. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* rewrite crystallographic part in python
  [IMPORTANT]

------------------ next release here 

* formula simplifications: "3/x" is changed to more complex "3*1/x"

* BUG, parsing problem: "i $a*$a" => Syntax error; "i 0+$a*$a" => OK

* (GUI) finish script debugger dialog -- add command editing, inserting
  and deleting commands, and changing the order of command.
  "Edit init file" from menu.

* (?)exporting data with info "info @n () [range] > file"
       should display ... [1234 lines more] rather than everything

* unused variables should not slow down fitting

* user defined functions:
      - more sophisticated simplifications of expressions and CSE(!)
      - calculating limits, width, area, etc. for UDF(!)

* GA fitting options, 
  a way to "shake" parameters for L-M

* small (eg. 1e-14) values of parameters are not handled properly.
   - make EPSILON an option when in configure script
   - warning if variable is set value: 0 < |value| < EPSILON

* un-strip background: what to do if active dataset is different than the one
  the background was removed for.

* EMG function: how to calculate it? Now there are some problems with
  this function. There must be smarter way to implement it...

* (GUI) plot horizontal/vertical lines (X/Y | pos=2.34 | 100%)
     can be used to show theoretical peak positions in XRD

* [BUG]: program crashes (MS Win 9x) when data contains NaN (as a result
  of asin(x) x>1) and "Zoom all" is called.

* (GUI) data-range mode: if all points are active, left mouse button
  should "select", not "activate", ie. it should do A = (left<x<right)  (?)

* (GUI) when printing, everything is first rescaled and rounded(!) for
  plot window at the screen, and then rescaled to the paper size. 
  This rounding causes visible artefacts at the printout.
  (wxDC.GetSize instead of plot.GetClientSize() ?)

* ? GUI: changing data point size and line separately for each dataset,

* data load, ascii: optimize, loading many datafiles is slow

* info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface Fit > Info

* (GUI) vertical scaling using mouse on main plot near to left edge of the plot 

* GUI [BUG] aux. plot - when program is called with script as an argument
   aux. plot looks strange at the start of the program until it is replotted

* improve Voigt function (cut-tails, better approx?) 

* (GUI) use numeric pad keys (WXK_NUMPAD_*) as shortcuts for changing 
	function parameters.

* GUI: it should be possible to constrain two parameters of two peak,
     at least to make them equal.

* GUI: easy way to do: F[hwhm]=..., F[shape]=...;

* GUI: button 'freeze' on variables pane

* Fitting 
	simulated annealing (it can replace LM shake_before option)
	perhaps also BFGS, conjugate gradients methods
	autoplot option -> fitting tab, checkbox: replot-after-fit-iteration
	                   perhaps also in Fit->Run dialog

* GUI: menu Functions:
  Functions > Peak-Find Info -> animation
  Functions > Multidata P-F Info -> window with list of parameters (Xview-like)

* Function: check_parameters_out_of_domain() ?  
             eg. in Pearson shape > 0.5 , shape < 1e9
	     called from fitting iteration?
	     what if parameter is out-of-domain? change? disable function?
	                                          change and freeze?
	     set fit-fix-parameters-times = 5
	    simple-var bounds?
	    ? $$simple = ~{min2(max2($simple, -1e9), 1e9)}

* GUI: Data Editor - left/right/top/bottom - magic keywords: user would be
       asked to select point/range/rectangle in plot

* cmd/GUI: plot peak-groups: ==> plot (%a+%b+%c)  

* (GUI) different peak-draft for sigmoids/steps (new function category), 
         and for other functions

* (GUI) where config files should be stored on MS Windows? Registry or file?

* (INTERNAL) use smart pointers: 
  http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm
  (the library will be distributed in 3rdparty/boost)

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* loading data -- use Difdaf library (when it will be ready) for powder
  diffraction data import.
  other formats (from survey): .jdx JCAMP-DX (www.jcamp.org)
		         Galactic (GRAMS/32) SPC files (especially multifiles)
			 Vamas (vms), 
			 multipart Siemens .raw data files
			 uxd,udf
  perhaps OPJ with liborigin and XLS with another library

* (GUI) single dialog for configuring main plot(?)
  data point size and other properties can be put on data pane(?)

* (GUI, BUG) in Configure axes / peak labels: fonts are changed event
  if Apply is not pressed

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user don't want to wait longer);
  use threads? or wxTimer?

* automatic background substraction - what are good algorithms?

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (COOOL,
  GAUL, WNLIB, netlib, OOL.sf.net, levmar)
  are there any other such libraries? 
  I haven't investigated the possibility of using mentioned libs yet.

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* Now only '.' is supported as a decimal separator. ',' should also
  be an option.

* investigate LLVM - can it be used for faster calculation of 
  user-defined functions?

* [BUG] (GUI) (MS Win) <br> does not work in vertical peak labels 

* exporting formulae in MathML (when option formula-export-style == mathml)
