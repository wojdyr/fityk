* finish parameter/variable transition:
   parameter domain ~3[2,14]
   mark parameters, which are not used in sum calculation
   recalculate() when neccessary (parameters change)
   history -- disabled for a while -- one for variables and functions
   replace gfunc.*, pag.h, ...

* d.transform y=x -> y=x, changes in GUI data editor and examples

* s.info -> print

* documentation for data transform, $variable assignments, etc

------------------ 0.5.2  2005.0?

* (GUI) peak positions as an option to any aux. plot 
        (not separate type of aux.p.)

* (GUI) new aux. plot type: cumulative chi2 (normalized, ie. cum. chi2 / (N-P))

* (GUI) show function limits when cursor is over peak top

* data tranformations: new functions: randuniform[a b]() randnormal[mu sigma]()

* d.activate, d.load, d.export -> data; d.info -> print

* (GUI) datapane - editable labels (titles)
                  "duplicate" command, when right-clicking on inactive label
		  [new dataset: title1 + title2] menu item

* problem: MS Windows - tree at data pane looks bad

* [del] button at data pane

* improve Voigt function (there is bug in FWHM, cut-tails, better approx?) 

------------------ 0.5.3  2005.0?

* view with/without background button (like in 0.4.x, requires storing
  background points)

* user defined functions: 
      - syntax:
        --> define Gaussian(a,pos,width): a*exp(-((x-pos)/width)^2)
	                    ^^^ any name but 'x' allowed here
	--> %g = Gaussian(1,$b,~3.4)
	--> %g2 = 1*exp(-((x-$b)/~3.4)^2)
      - `%g' in data transform (Y=y-%g -> peak removal)
      - to avoid ambiguity, transform '%' operator should be replaced with 'mod'
      - more sophisticated simplifications of expressions and CSE(!)
      - calculating limits, width, area, etc. for UDF(!)

------------------ 0.6.0 2005.??

* data transform: variable step -> fixed step (i.e. x[n]-x[n-1] is constant)

* (INTERNAL) put `const' always behind the type

* rewrite scanner/parser using only boost::spirit. 
  (in progress, now it uses both Spirit and flex/bison).

* (INTERNAL) propagate errors using exceptions (when suitable) rather 
  than error codes

* (INTERNAL) use smart pointers: 
  http://www.boost.org/libs/smart_ptr/smart_ptr.htm
  (the library will be distributed in 3rdparty/boost)

* build engine (everything but GUI/CLI interface) as a library
  with documented API.

* problem: fityk can't be compiled with UNICODE-enabled wxWidgets

* (WWW) update screenshots 

* there are problems with refreshing plots and output window when program
  is busy (ie. when running script or fitting). It seems to be platform
  dependent.

* write a good portable .spec (spec is used for building RPM)

* auto-freezing of peaks at disactivated range

* (GUI) file preview (in grid) in "Load File Custom" dialog 
  setting initial path to currently loaded file (calling SetPath() 
  is giving segfault, don't know why) 
  Perhaps use wxGenericFileDialog instead of wxGenericDirCtrl (?)

* integrate m.findpeak and s.add options. Prepare interface for many
  peak detection algorithms

* document s.guess command 

* logarithmic scale  

* (s.add) possibility to add description of peak/parameter 
  This description could be used e.g. in exporting files.

* loading data -- use Difdaf library (when it will be ready) for powder
  diffraction data import.
  other formats (from survey): .jdx JCAMP-DX (www.jcamp.org)
		         Galactic (GRAMS/32) SPC files (especially multifiles)

* (GUI) one dialog for plot settings. More precise configuration of axis tics.
  horizontal/vertical peak labels, etc.
  single ergonomic interface changing colors of everything

* python scripts  -- built-in Python interpreter which allows to extend 
  Fityk using user-written scripts, optional modules, etc. 
  [IMPORTANT]

* rewrite crystallographic part in python
  [IMPORTANT]

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user don't want to wait longer);
  use threads?

* automatic background substraction - what are good algorithms?

* (s.export) when exporting function/sum as points, it shuld be possible 
  to set step of these points (s.set export-points-step = 0.?)
  and to export baseline and each peak as a separately (multicolumn CSV)

* (Windows only) exporting plots to PostScript file and to metafile(clipboard) 

* more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* write documentation for fwhm-correction and height-correction (m.set) 

* fitting: it should be separated even more from the rest of the program.
  Perhaps it fitting functions should be in extern library (COOOL,
  GAUL, WNLIB, netlib, OOL.sf.net
  are there any other such libraries? 
  I haven't investigated the possibility of using mentioned libs yet. 
  Links: http://coool.mines.edu/ http://gaul.sourceforge.net/, 
  http://www.willnaylor.com/wnlib.html,
  http://sal.jyu.fi/B/3/index.shtml, http://coin-or.org,
  http://www-unix.mcs.anl.gov/otc/Guide/faq/nonlinear-programming-faq.html) 

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* f.info -- more informations about error, confidence limits, etc.
  graphical interface to f.info; 
  easy way to get (write to file) parameters with errors [IMPORTANT]

* Now only '.' is supported as a decimal separator. ',' should also
  be an option.

* (GUI) "Report Bug" item in Help menu, clickable link in About dialog
        http://wiki.wxwidgets.org/wiki.pl?Launching_The_Default_Browser

* investigate LLVM - can it be used for faster calculation of 
  user-defined functions?
