Help is needed:

|- C++ coding: see the list of ideas at the end of this file
|- documentation: convert the manual from DocBook to reStructuredText
`- graphics: make PNG icons for toolbar. XPM format (now in use) doesn't support
   alpha channel, and the toolbar doesn't look good.


---------- TODO list and tentative development plan  ----------------

* GUI, MSW, bug: default/alternative configs use .fityk dir 

* BUG: 'info formula' crashes when EMG function is in the formula 

* BUG: caching data gives suprising effects if the data file was changed
  since the last reading

--------------> 0.8.7

* powder diffraction add-on - Pawley fitting 

--------------> 0.9.0

* GUI: Data>Load should use default load dir (as Quick Load)

* GUI, Fit > Info - a dialog that should contain all the information from
                    info fit and info+ errors commands

* [BUG] parsing problems: "a=a" => OK (should be error)  "a=ab" => Syntax error

* FFT (forward and backward) data transformation,
  convolution and deconvolution of two datasets
  (implement both using code from Kiss FFT library)

* (GUI) plot horizontal/vertical lines 
     can be used to show theoretical peak positions in XRD
     (or to make stress-strain curves in MD with marked simulation restarts)
     Syntax: 
             plot line x=42.2 label="foo" in @*
             plot line y=1000.3 label="foo" in @*
             plot no lines in @*

* convert manual from DocBook to reStructuredText

* reading sessions saved with dump command is very slow if datasets contain
  a large number of points. Optimize it: when reading a line from script, 
  check first, using sscanf(), if it is a data point.

--------------> 0.9.1

* GUI: refactor MainPlot - mouse event handling based on subscriptions,
       a clean interface to XOR-drawing 

* GUI: should (and where) windows size & position be stored?

* (GUI) stopping fitting interactively (when user doesn't want to wait longer);
  "stop" bitmap button? in right left corner? 

* data import: possibility to use xylib column/block name as title

* xylib: allow compressed (.gz, .bz2) data files (only in standalone version,
  if Boost.Iostreams headers and libbzip2 and/or zlib are present)

* configure.ac: 
  --enable-samples-install  Install samples as documentation 
    (to .../share/doc/fityk/samples/, only *.fit and *.dat files)

* magic default parameters: if $default__name is defined: when functions 
  with parameter `name' are "guessed", this parameter is set to $default__name

* GUI: it should be possible to constrain two parameters of two peak 
     (using mouse and peak-top menu), at least to make them equal.

* A way to define split functions as UDFs.
  E.g. by adding a switch to CompoundFunction:
  SplitGaussian(h, c, hwhm1, hwhm2) = if x < c then Gaussian(h,c,hwhm1) else...

* GUI: on "Guess function" toolbar button: if initial values are not known,
  show a dialog asking for the values.

* add a new function category: sigmoids/steps (now function can be guessed as
  "peak" and "linear"). (GUI): drawing drafts for the new category.

* "auto-freeze" option in settings, that automatically locks/unlocks all 
  parameters of a peak when the data range containing the center of this peak 
  is disactivated/activated

--------------> 

* add alpha channel to toolbar icons

* (GUI) single dialog for configuring main plot (and also aux. plots) (?)
  - now in Configure axes / peak labels fonts are changed (but shouldn't) 
    even if Apply is not pressed 
  - option to change the width of the sum line (and other lines)
  - ? changing data point size and line separately for each dataset,

* unused variables should not slow down fitting

* (GUI) vertical scaling using mouse on main plot near to left edge of the plot 

* a command to delete all functions or variables

* support variables in range in data transformation: Y[$foo-1] = 0

------------------ 

* GUI: use wxGraphicsContext or Cairo for drawing plots with antialiasing

* GUI, enhancements for the script editor: 
       - "info ...> file" marked differently than not redirected info 
       - paths of files to be read should be checked 
       - ? search'n'replace button

* user defined functions:
      - more sophisticated simplifications of expressions and CSE
      - calculating limits, width, area, etc. for UDF
      - ?? optionally use LLVM for faster calculation of user-defined functions

* EMG function: how to calculate it? Now there are some problems with
  this function. There must be smarter way to implement it...
  perhaps using gsl_sf_log_erfc or exp(x*x)*erfc(x) from
  http://www.netlib.org/specfun/erf

* improve Voigt function (cut-tails, better approx.) 
  eg. http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=77626.77629

* ? confidence intervals for data

* GUI: menu Functions:
  Functions > Peak-Find Info -> animation
  Functions > Multidata P-F Info -> window with list of parameters (Xview-like)

* ? box-constrained simple variables 

* ?fitting with enforcing valid function's parameters: 
    eg. in Pearson shape > 0.5 , shape < 1e9
    what if parameter is out of domain? change? disable function?

* ? cmd/GUI: plot peak-groups: ==> plot (%a+%b+%c)  

* ?GUI: Data Editor - left/right/top/bottom - magic keywords: user would be
       asked to select point/range/rectangle in plot

* ? more sophisticated algorithms for peak detection

* fitting: GA fitting options, 
  a way to "shake" parameters for L-M

* fitting:
	simulated annealing (it can replace LM shake_before option)
	perhaps also BFGS, conjugate gradients methods

* fitting: investigate using a library for nonlinear fitting/optimization:
  I don't know about any library good enough to justify migration.

* fitting: robust fit - other error distributions then Gaussian, 
  eg. Lorenzian...; so called 'maximum-likelihood method' -- using Poisson
  error distribution.

* [BUG] (GUI) (MS Win) <br> does not work in vertical peak labels 

* ? exporting formulae in MathML (when option formula-export-style == mathml)

* [BUG, won't be fixed]: program crashes on MS Win 9x when data contains NaN 
  (e.g. as a result of asin(x) x>1) and "Zoom all" is called.

-------  Anticipated upgrades  -----------

* when Boost::Spirit 2 is released, parsers will be rewritten and 
  libfityk will be made thread-safe (removing all `AL' and all static class 
  members and global variables)

* when wxWidgets 3.x will be available in major Linux distributions:
  - open-file dialog (with preview) will use XyBrowser
  - file dialogs will be changed to take adventage of custom controls:
      * Choose log file: add "log also output" checkbox
      * Data > Export will be done in one step
      * "Export formula" dialog will have formula-export-style option
  - button '(un)lock' on variables pane (wxToggleBitmapButton)
  - Redesign Data Editor:  
       - use wxDataViewCtrl for spreadsheet.
       - the spreadsheet should be a separate dialog, and it should also 
	 be available in "Transformation Mgr" on clicking "Data>>" button
       - use wxDataViewCtrl instead of wxListCtrl
       - no extra dialog for adding transformation
       - remove "description" field, use comments in "code" instead
   
  - use wxDataViewCtrl for the lists at the sidebar,
    refactor ListWithColors::populate(), add sorting by clicking on column 
    header (use case: sort functions by centers)
  - use wxToggleBitmapButton buttons on sidebar>functions (buttons that make 
    hwhm and shape equal for all functions)

-------  Ideas for people, who would like to contribute:  -----------

- write a function to calculate a Voigt/Faddeeva function, based on one 
  (or more) of papers published about it. I mean here an approximation more 
  exact that the standard Humlicek one. GSL would probably also accept
  such a function in C.
  http://sources.redhat.com/ml/gsl-discuss/2004-q4/msg00061.html

- see the note about EMG function above

- if you have some expertise in nonlinear optimization methods, it's possible
  to do what Gnu Scientific Library seems to plan: put a few least-squares
  fitting methods with similar interface into one library. 
  It can be part of fityk, a separate library or a part of GSL.

- Add alpha channel to toolbar icons. Fityk icons are usually modified GTK 
  stock icons. Alpha-channel was removed when converting to xpm format.
  Now I see icons with alpha-channel look much better (like menu icons,
  visible in GTK version only), but making the icons again takes time...

- (wxWidgets): On the sidebar FancyRealCtrl is used for changing parameters:
  http://wxforum.shadonet.com/viewtopic.php?t=13471
  It would be better to use a custom (3D?) control instead of wxSlider,
  perhaps similar to controls used in Google Earth for zoom and tilt.

- anything else
