	These 3 files are from Michael Richardson <michael.richardson@vuw.ac.nz.
	
fomlin_y.vms is got by googling "VAMAS Surface Chemical Analysis Standard Data Transfer Format filetype:vms"


All other files are got from a place I've forgotten, seems a free formats inter-converter's test data.
The following are the README file along with those sample files.

* IMPLEMENTATION REF
=======================
The xylib implementation of VAMAS format is mainly based on a paper published on "SURFACE AND INTERFACE ANALYSIS" vol. 13, 1988: "VAMAS Surface Chemical Analysis Standard Data Transfer Format with Skeleton Decoding Programs" by W. A. Dench et at.
This is a very detailed specification of this format.
