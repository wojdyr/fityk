TODO:

* complete the testmain code

* Detect file format by file contant (magic number), in case some types share one extension name. For example, Brucker v1 and v2 Raw File both use ".raw" as extension name.

* Add more format types, of course



////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
* Finish generic function to handle the UXD-like files, done!

* Change the mechanism of unknown file format detection: 
	1. by the file extension name
	2. by previewing the first lines of the file content to find the format-specified strings. And checking this of every format can be written as independent functions which can be used to verify the correctness when user calls load_file with a specified file_type.

* Make the text file reading more flexible. 	
	e.g. headers can be skipped and columns can be specified
	use boost::regex to process the text files
