This is version of xylib modified and integrated with fityk.
For original xylib see: 
  http://www.sf.net/projects/xylib
  SVN: https://xylib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/xylib


PURPOSE
=======
xylib is a library for reading various x-y data format. 

xylib was created as a project in Google Summer of Code 2007 
(see http://code.google.com/soc), assigned to fityk organization 
(http://www.unipress.waw.pl/fityk/). 


SUPPORTED FORMATS
=================
X-Y plain text format
Siemens/Bruker uxd
Diffrac-AT raw v1/2/3
Philips UDF Format
Rigaku Dat Format
Vamas ISO14976
   only experiment modes: "SEM" or "MAPSV" or "MAPSVDP" are supported
   only "REGULAR" scan_mode is supported
Princeton Instruments WinSpec SPE Format
   only 1-D data is supported
Philips RD raw scan format V3
Crystallographic Information File for Powder Diffraction
GSAS format


FILES
============
xylib/
    xylib.h 
    xylib.cpp 
    	xylib functions and main classes.
    
    util.h
    util.cpp
    	Internal-used helper functions in namespace xylib::util.
    		
    Other .cpp/.h files correspond to supported file formats.
	
xyconv.cpp
    A user tool with arguments to convert xylib-supported file to ASCII file.
	
samples/
    run get_samples.sh to download sample files

samples.sh
     Shell script that converts all of the sample files in ./sample 
     to ASCII plain format in ./output

	
USAGE
=====
See xylib/xylib.h for library API
xyconv is a simple converting program and an example how to use the library

HOW TO EXTEND 
=============
If you want to contribute to xylib by adding new file formats-support to it, follow the following steps:
1. Create the two necessary ds_foo.cpp and ds_foo.h files
2. Add a type of your format to enum xy_ftype in xylib.h before FT_NUM, keep in mind that the order o xy_ftype must be kept.
3. Add the ds_xxx.h that you just added to the include list in xylib.cpp
4. Add the const static FormatInfo member in your XXXDataSet to the global const array g_fi, in xylib.cpp
5. Update the functions in xylib to let them know you new DataSet: getNewDataSet, guess_file_type.
6. Add Foo sample files to ./samples/foo/* and update the corresponding README file to tell others where these files are got from, if you have the right to re-distribution of them. Otherwise, add a shell script which can download those sample files from a public-accessible URL.
7. Complete the source code in ds_foo.cpp/.h.
There are some things need to be done, in order to keep your newly-add code compatible with the framework.
	* A class FooDataSet derived from the base DataSet
	* A const static FormatInfo member fmt_info in FooDataSet: is set with some related information of this format.
	* Member function check(std::istream &f): perform some basic format checking. Return true if the check passes, false otherwise.
	* Member function load_data(std::istream &f): parse the format, read in the X-Y data and related meta-info.
	* Some functions if needed. Make the format-specific functions as the member functions of FooDataSet, and the more general functions (may be used elsewhere) as global functions in the namespace xylib::util.

THANKS
======
First of all, I'd like to thank my mentor Marcin Wojdyr for his careful and in-time mentoring during the whole project process. He spent lots of time to review my code and gave me many good suggestions about the library design and implementation.
I'd like to thank Google for hosting the GSoC project to promote the Open Source Software in the globe. 
Thanks to Michael Richardson <michael.richardson@vuw.ac.nz>, for his kind help to send us a specification of VAMAS format and some sample files, and suggestions for the JCAMP-DX paper download URL.
Thanks to David Hovis <dbh6@case.edu>, for sending us a WinSpec file format specification and the sample file.
Thanks to Pablo Bianucci <pbian@physics.utexas.edu>, for sending us a WinSpec implentation source code and an SPE sample file.
Thanks to Brian H. Toby <Brian.Toby@anl.gov>, for his useful info and suggestions about the pdCIF format.
Thanks to Martijn Fransen <martijn.fransen@panalytical.com>, for sending us a very useful specification on Philips raw formats.
And thanks to all people who have helped me and gave suggestions to the xylib project.
